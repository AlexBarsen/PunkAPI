# PunkAPI

This my first project regarding Web Development I've built, it is a application built in pure HTML, CSS  and JS 
in which you can search for beers and view information about those by fetching 
information from the Punk API beer collection.

I did this project in order to learn the basics of Javascript, HTML & CSS.

It doesn't feature media queries or error handling, it was done just for the purpose of putting into practice what i learned in my first weeks of studying web dev.

In order to run the project:
- download/fetch it
- npm install to install the packages used
- npm run
